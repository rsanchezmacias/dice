# dice

Dice is a simple application written in pure HTML, CSS, and JS. As name implies, it just allows 
a user to roll a pair of dice. 

Feel free to take a look at the [page](https://rsanchezmacias.github.io/dice/)!


The application was done as part of Dr. Angela Yu's web development Udemy bootcamp.
